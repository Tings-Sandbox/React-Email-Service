===========================

Thank you for taking the time to complete the KQED Media Technology code challenge. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your expertise and ablity to problem solve an assignment similar to what you would be expected to do at KQED.

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

Functional spec
---------------

Prototype one of the following projects:

1. TV/Radio Scheduler
2. SF Movies, Performances, Events
3. Email Service
4. Search for KQED, NPR, or PBS TV or radio programs

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!

### TV/Radio Scheduler

Create a service that gives real-time radio or tv times for public broadcasting (use freely available public API). The app should geolocalize the user.

Here are some examples of freely available data:

[Public Media Programs](http://publicmediaplatform.org/)
[National Public Radio API](http://www.npr.org/api/inputReference.php)
[PBS API](https://projects.pbs.org/confluence/display/coveapi/COVE+API+Version+1)

### SF Performances/Movies

Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in the San Francisco Bay Area. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Film
Locations](https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am).

### Email Service

Create a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails. It should provide an abstraction between two different email service providers. If one of the services goes down, your service can quickly failover to a different provider without affecting your customers.

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#sending-messages)
* [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.JSON.html#method-send)
* [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendEmail.html)

All listed services are free to try and are pretty painless to sign up for, so
please register your own test accounts on each.

### Food Trucks

Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found
near a specific location on a map.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food
Trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat)

Technical spec
--------------

The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. Feel free to use any other technologies provided that the general client/service architecture is respected.

Full-stack: include both front-end and back-end.

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them. Therefore, feel free to mention in your README how much experience you have with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing your challenge.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* PHP
* Go
* Java

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

### Front-end

The front-end should ideally be a single page app with a single index.html linking to external JS/CSS/etc. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

Host it!

When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).

Good luck!
